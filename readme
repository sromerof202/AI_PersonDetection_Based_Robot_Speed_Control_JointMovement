# Person-Detection-Based Robot Speed Control

This project uses a YOLO model to detect persons in the frames captured by a camera. Depending on whether a person is detected or not, it adjusts the speed of a robot. The robot's joints are moved in a pattern, and the speed of these movements is controlled based on the presence or absence of a person in the camera's view.
